<h1>My Flight Radar App - Reduxjs Toolkit </h1>

The Flight Radar application I developed allows users to track instant flights over Turkey and access detailed flight information. The application allows users to instantly view the routes, departure and arrival terminals, airports, aircraft names, and tail codes of flights in Turkey. With the Leaflet library, aircraft routes are visualized on the map, allowing users to easily track flight movements. Users can access comprehensive information about flights by viewing aircraft photos, departure and arrival times, and possible delays on the aircraft detail page. Using the Redux Toolkit and React-Redux, the status of the application is effectively managed, while instant data flow and user interactions are responded to quickly. In the list view page of the application, information about all aircraft is presented in an orderly manner, allowing users to easily access the data they want. React Paginate integration allows users to easily navigate between flight lists, allowing users to quickly access the data they want.
